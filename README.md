# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-Java-Console-Based-
This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java for two players. The game is played on a 3Ã—3 grid where players take turns to enter their move by specifying the row and column numbers.

- The board is initialized as a 3x3 character array filled with spaces.
- Players 'X' and 'O' alternate turns.
- The program checks for a win condition after every move:
- Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment of three same symbols (X or O) results in a win.
- If a player attempts to place their symbol in an already filled cell, an "Invalid move" message is shown.
- The game continues until a player wins.

This program demonstrates the use of:

- 2D arrays for board representation
- Loops for board traversal
- Conditional logic for win-checking
- Basic input handling using Scanner
